This is the very preliminary design for my reprap. its loosly based on a mendel 90 and prusa 2 hybrid design with a few
added features.

The name pjrun comes from my initial (pjr) and un (unified) as its actually my 4th design, this one is roughly a month old
and as i currently have a m90, this design is my attempted at fixing some of its shortcomings, while adding a few extra features

All the cad files are freecad and are designed based on 8mm rods and 12mm mdf.

The base MDF isnt actually needed, but it can be either half-width (only covering one half of the y axis) or full width (the
entire length of the y axis).
